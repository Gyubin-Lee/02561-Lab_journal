#### What filtering option that you choose that better the minification issues without too much blurring of the texture?

##### For the texture minification issues, I choosed gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR as the filtering mode. This is a trilinear filtering method that combines both mipmapping and linear interpolation to improve texture quality at smaller sizes.
